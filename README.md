# About 
The House Price dataset encompasses a variety of features, including crime rate, residential area, quality of air, room number, age, distance, teachers, property status, airport, beds, rooms, water body, rainfall, bus terminals, and presence of parks. This dataset can help buyers, sellers, and real estate agents make educated decisions by providing insights into the dynamics of the property market. The issue was that it was impossible to anticipate the prices of houses because the dataset was not clean. I trained the model using three distinct methods after thoroughly cleaning the dataset using a variety of strategies I've learned. After eliminating unnecessary columns and converting categorical variables using encoding techniques, exploratory data analysis was carried out, the model was trained, and finally, the chosen final model underwent parameter tuning. I eagerly await your opinions and glowing testimonials.
# Model
To choose the prediction method with the best performance, the model underwent testing and training. The algorithms that were employed included Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. Ultimately, the Decision Tree Model's superior performance over the other models led to its selection.
# Instructions on how to run the Model
- Download the files (house price csv dataset and python file (.ipynb)) and save both in the same folder.
-	Run the file on jupyter notebook
-	Run python train.py on a terminal
-	Serve the model via a flask, predict.py file
-	Build the docker container
-	Run the docker container
# Dependencies
- â€¢	You can easily install the dependencies and use the venv environment
